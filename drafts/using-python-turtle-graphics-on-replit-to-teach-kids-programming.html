      <p>I've always enjoyed teaching programming and computer science concepts to adults. I've even been so haughty as to 
consider myself good at it. I've long thought that teaching computer science at the high school level would
be an ideal retirement job, although I don't actually have any experience to confirm that notion. So this past year
I decided to do some volunteer work in order to see what it's really like. Unfortunately, the county high school wasn't
really reponsive to my offer to help out even though they don't offer any programming. I guess they were feeling overwhelmed due to COVID. 
So instead of experiencing teaching at the high school level, I've been "forced" to help out at the local grade school. This is a rural grade school
with about 25 students in K-8th. Many are from local ranching families. I initially offered to teach coding to the 6th-8th graders,
but the teacher requested that I include 3-5th grade as well, to which I meekly replied <code>...Okay...</code></p>
<p>TLDR, I go to the school once a month and conduct two-hour coding workshops. They've been super fun. I didn't really get what I wanted but what 
I ended up getting has been a very rich and rewarding experience. I've loved plugging into the community a bit more, and it's rewarding to know 
I'm helping the school my kids are a part of. But enough needless backstory - this isn't a cooking blog - I'm here to discuss some of my experiences
and the successes I've had using Python + Turtle Graphics on repl.it to easily get kids going, get them excited and expose them to fundamental coding concepts.</p>
<p>Two hours is a long time, especially for kids in the younger grades. </p>
<p>I was delighted to discover that most of the kids had already been exposed to some visual programming through things like Grasshopper</p>
